# Notes

What generating functions should users be allowed to use (pois, negbin, empirical)

Eviction (L58-60), (See Jessica WIlliams paper).  
-  Ways to handle (kill evicts, create separate discrete size class)


Functions that take the functional

-   Asymptotic extinction prob (iterating the functional to steady state)
-   Given population dist, what is extinction prob over time (currently prob())
