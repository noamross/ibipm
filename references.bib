  Abstract                 = {Permits to destroy wetlands often require the creation of the same type of wetland elsewhere. An assumption underlying this practice is that such created wetlands will replace the ecological functions lost when the developed wetland was destroyed. Part of this ecological function is providing habitat for wildlife, including, in coastal areas, a suite of bird species tied to salt marshes for some portion of their life cycle. We tested the hypothesis that created wetlands provide habitat for the avian communities lost when wetlands are destroyed by comparing the breeding and wintering birds on 11 small created salt marshes with those on 11 natural reference salt marshes that were carefully matched for size and surrounding land cover. We found that, during the breeding season, created salt marshes had lower avian abundance and richness than reference salt marshes. In particular, wetland-dependent species were poorly represented on created wetlands. On the other hand, bird use outside of the breeding season and use by an important salt marsh obligate species, the clapper rail (\emph{Rallus longirostris}), did not differ. Created wetlands that we surveyed failed to completely replicate the bird and plant communities that we observed on nearby natural reference salt marshes, raising the question of whether current mitigation policies that encourage wetland creation should continue without further investigation into the success of such wetlands at recreating wildlife habitat.},

  Abstract                 = {Intraguild predation occurs when one species (the intraguild predator) predates on and competes with another species (the intraguild prey). A classic model of this interaction was introduced by Gary Polis and Robert Holt building on a model of competing species by Thomas Schoener. A global analysis reveals that this model exhibits generically six dynamics: extinction of one or both species; coexistence about a globally stable equilibrium; contingent exclusion in which the first established species prevents the establishment of the other species; contingent coexistence in which coexistence or displacement of the intraguild prey depend on initial conditions; exclusion of the intraguild prey; and exclusion of the intraguild predator. Implications for biological control and community ecology are discussed},

  Abstract                 = {Recent theories regarding the evolution of predator-prey interactions is reviewed. This includes theory about the dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on stability may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically structured populations promises to advance our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models are used to explore the interaction between two prey species that share a common predator. The models assume that the predator experiences density dependence via some mechanism other than prey depletion. The models also assume that the predator's functional response to each prey decreases as the density of the other prey species increases. This can occur either because of predator satiation or predator switching. The results suggest that positive indirect effects of one prey on the equilibrium density of others should occur frequently, especially when there is predator switching. Decreasing the mortality rate of one prey or adding a prey species may make it easier for additional prey species to invade the system and coexist. This occurs because the resulting decrease in the predator's functional response is greater than its positive numerical response. In many cases, different magnitudes of perturbation to one prey species will have opposite effects on the population density of the other prey species.}

  Abstract                 = {In many predator-prey systems, prey individuals make transitions between vulnerable and invulnerable states or locations. The invulnerable (or less vulnerable) class can be individuals occupying a spatial refuge or those engaged in activities that greatly reduce the risk of predation. Simple models are used to show that transitions between such classes have the following consequences: (1) equilibrium prey density increases as the conditions of prey growth are improved and (2) enrichment often cannot destabilize systems with stable equilibrium densities and many stabilize systems that are undergoing limit cycle oscillations. Transitions to and from invulnerable states therefore represent a possible explanation for the lack of examples of destabilization via fertilization ("the paradox of enrichment") in nature. Other theoretical reasons for the apparent absence of the paradox or enrichment are reviewed, and methods of distinguishing the different mechanism are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental fluctuations often have different impacts on individuals that differ in size, age, or spatial location. To understand how population structure, environmental fluctuations, and density-dependent interactions influence population dynamics, we provide a general theory for persistence for density-dependent matrix models in random environments. For populations with compensating density dependence, exhibiting ``bounded'' dynamics, and living in a stationary environment, we show that persistence is determined by the stochastic growth rate (alternatively, dominant Lyapunov exponent) when the population is rare. If this stochastic growth rate is negative, then the total population abundance goes to zero with probability one. If this stochastic growth rate is positive, there is a unique positive stationary distribution. Provided there are initially some individuals in the population, the population converges in distribution to this stationary distribution and the empirical measures almost surely converge to the distribution of the stationary distribution. For models with overcompensating density-dependence, weaker results are proven. Methods to estimate stochastic growth rates are presented. To illustrate the utility of these results, applications to unstructured, spatially structured, and stage-structured population models are given. For instance, we show that diffusively coupled sink populations can persist provided that within patch fitness is sufficiently variable in time but not strongly correlated across space. !!},

  Abstract                 = {Generalized P{\'o}lya urn models can describe the dynamics of finite populations of interacting genotypes. Three basic questions these models can address are: Under what conditions does a population exhibit growth? On the event of growth, at what rate does the population increase? What is the long-term behavior of the distribution of genotypes? To address these questions, we associate a mean limit ordinary differential equation (ODE) with the urn model. Previously, it has been shown that on the event of population growth, the limiting distribution of genotypes is a connected internally chain recurrent set for the mean limit ODE. To determine when growth and convergence occurs with positive probability, we prove two results. First, if the mean limit ODE has an ``attainable'' attractor at which growth is expected, then growth and convergence toward this attractor occurs with positive probability. Second, the population distribution almost surely does not converge to sets where growth is not expected and almost surely does not converge to ``nondegenerate'' unstable equilibria or periodic orbits of the mean limit ODE. Applications to stochastic analogs of the replicator equations and fertility-selection equations of population genetics are given. !!},

  Abstract                 = {An age-structured model in which two parasitoid species attack different developmental stages of a single host species is developed. Two versions of the model, differing in the outcome of larval competition, are presented. In the first version, hosts that are parasitized by the egg parasitoid cannot be attacked later by the larval parasitoid. In this version, the two species are not able to coexist. The egg parasitoid gains a competitive advantage through attacking the earlier host stage. The species that wins in competition is not necessarily the one that would produce the lowest adult host density. In the second version, hosts that are parasitized by the egg parasitoid can later be attacked by the larval parasitoid, which produces an adult of the larval parasitoid species. In this case, the two species can coexist because hosts that have previously been parasitized by the egg parasitoid serve as an additional resource for the larval parasitoid. When the two species do coexist, the density of each of the stages of the host is intermediate between the densities obtained when each of the two parasitoid species is present alone. These results suggest that the lowest host density in cases of biological control may be achieved by the release of only the most effective parasitoid rather than multiple parasitoid species.},

  Abstract                 = {Charnov and Schaffer's (1973) model for annual versus perennial reproduction in plants has been extended to include both density dependence and environmental variability. Two models of density dependence were investigated, and the method of invasibility analysis (Turelli 1978) was used to study their behavior. The results are interpreted in terms of bet-hedging theory; it is shown that the criticisms of this interpretation by Hastings and Caswell (1979) are unfounded.},

  Abstract                 = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

  Abstract                 = {Microtus pennsylvanicus is the only rodent native to small islands in the Gulf of Maine. Peromyscus maniculatus is found on larger islands, even when rather remote, while Clethrionomys gapperi occurs only on the largest islands within 1 mile of the mainland. Population dynamics and rates of extinction and recolonization of resident Microtus populations were studied from 1962 to 1972. During this period, the ability of Peromyscus and Clethrionomys to establish and maintain insular populations was tested through experimental introductions of from one to eight pairs. Empirical determinations of demographic parameters provide data consistent with the MacArthur-Wilson model for propagule survivorship, and propagule sizes are of the same order of magnitude as those predicted by the model. Average survival (T$_1$) of propagules and time to ultimate extinction (T$_K$) of established populations of the three species also agree with theoretical expectations. The distribution of the three species in the Gulf of Maine is largely accounted for by the equilibrium theory of MacArthur and Wilson. Its ability to disperse across water, to establish reproducing populations, and to attain high densities in the available habitat allow Microtus to succeed as an insular species in spite of frequent extinction. These properties are viewed as extensions of its role as a fugitive species in mainland habitats. Peromyscus is found on larger islands where carrying capacity is sufficient to preclude extinction, while Clethrionomys is found only on the largest and least isolated islands. While competition with Microtus may contribute to the poor success of experimental introductions of Clethrionomys and might forestall natural colonization, absence of Clethrionomys from most islands is attributed primarily to limited dispersal. Because immigration to distant islands depends on rare events while low extinction rates allow oversaturation of large land-bridge islands, I conclude that small mammals reach equilibrium only on small coastal islands. The means of dispersal are determined by local conditions, and successful species may vary between island groups.},

  Abstract                 = {I discuss two classes of models that predict patterns of dispersal across heterogeneous environments; the source-sink and balanced dispersal models. Data collected during a long-term study of small mammals in an experimentally fragmented landscape support the predictions of the balanced dispersal model. In addition, a literature review indicates that for 28 species, few empirical studies have enough detailed demographic data to distinguish between assumptions of the two models and to test their predictions. The review indicates both models are poorly supported by empirical studies and many of the studies cited as evidence for source-sink dynamics cannot distinguish a sink habitat from a habitat with a low carrying capacity. I conclude that a continuum should exist between species vagility and the dispersal patterns seen in heterogeneous landscapes. Species with high vagility and the ability to assess habitat quality should tend towards balanced dispersal. In species with low vagility or where dispersal is controlled by abiotic factors (wind, or water currents), source-sink dynamics will be more common. Investigators must collect detailed demographic and movement data if they hope to test these models and further our understanding of the role of spatial dynamics in ecology.},

  Abstract                 = {Resulting from demosgraphic stochasticity, larger propagules (number of colonizers) are predicted to colonize islands with a higher degree of success. However, minimum number of individuals needed to establish a population, with a certain probability, is also dependent on demographic parameters, such as natality and mortality. This paper examines the effect of propagule size on colonization success, using two demographically different populations of the bank vole [Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780)]. Bank voles from Northern and Southern Sweden were experimentally introduced on twenty islands each, in the Stockholm Archipelago. Propagules consisted of two, four, ten or twenty voles. A simulation model was used to predict extinction probabilities, based on demographic stochasticity. Southern voles had a natality to mortality ratio above unity, and larger propagules colonized more effectively than did smaller, as predicted. Northern voles, with a natality to mortality ratio below unity, were all predicted to go extinct, but time to extinction was predicted to be dependent on propagule size. This pattern was observed. The original simple colonization model proposed by MacArthur & Wilson was found to predict colonization success as accurately as the more complex simulation model.},

  Abstract                 = {Intransitive competition has the potential to be a powerful contributor to species coexistence, but there are few proposed biological mechanisms that could create intransitivities in natural communities. Using a three-species model of competition for space, we demonstrate a mechanism for coexistence that combines a colonization-competition trade-off between two species with the ability of a third species to preempt space from the other competitors. The combination of differential abilities to colonize, preempt, and overtake space creates a community where no single species can exclude both of its competitors. The dynamics of this kind of community are analogous to rock-paper-scissors competition, and the three-species community can persist even though not all pairs of species can coexist in isolation. In distinction to prior results, this is a mechanism of intransitivity that does not require nonhierarchical local interference competition. We present parameter estimates from a subtidal marine community illustrating how documented competitive traits can lead to preemption-based intransitivities in natural communities, and we describe methods for an empirical test of the occurrence of this mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The generalist feeding strategy of larvae of the western tree hole mosquito, Aedes sierrensis, is central to understanding the community-level effects of the tritrophic interactions among mosquito larvae, midsized organisms (such as protozoa), and lower-level organisms (such as bacteria and fungi) in west coast phytotelmata. Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize the feeding strategies of Ae. sierrensis larvae in the presence of multiple resource types (free-swimming protozoa and substrate-bound particulate material). In our experiment, we quantified the effects of varying instar numbers and profile, resource type, and refuge size on predation of protozoa. Refugia were explicitly modeled in our microcosms, representing the interstitial spaces of leaf litter and the wood lining of natural tree holes. Results from these microcosm experiments suggested that: (1) Even in the absence of larvae, the majority of protozoa resided in the small-volume, resource-rich refugia. There was, however, a strong nonlinear and negative relationship between larval densities in the upper compartment and the protozoan densities in the refuge, suggesting that there was continual movement of protozoa between the two spaces. (2) Fourth instars harvested resources by filter-feeding at a higher rate than second instars. (3) As the level of substrate-bound particulate food was increased, the predation pressure by filter-feeding on the protozoa decreased. (4) As the refuge volume increased, the predation pressure on the protozoa decreased. We constructed a three-state-variable mathematical model describing the generalist feeding behavior of Ae. sierrensis larvae. The model system, with constant predator densities and two prey groups, exhibited full cooperativity; i.e., an increase in protozoa density resulted in a shift toward predation by filter feeding, while an increase in substrate-bound resources resulted in a shift toward predation by browsing. This indirect mutualism is mechanistically distinct from previously published systems and provides a potential mechanism for protozoan persistence in the presence of larval predation.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Hudson's Bay Company and some other records provide a record of lynx (Lynx canadensis) fur collections in Canada for 206 years. Details for smaller regions have been obtained for 1821-1934 or 1937. The regions have been constructed from the original fur trade districts, in such a way as to give fairly standard areas for comparing catches over long periods. 2. The cycle in lynx furs is very violent and regular and has persisted unchanged for the whole period. Its average period is about 9.6 years. 3. This cycle is a real one in lynx populations, which are dependent upon the snowshoe rabbit (Lepus americanus) for food, and which starve when the rabbits disappear periodically. It is therefore strong evidence of a similar cycle in snowshoe rabbits for the last 206 years. 4. The wide synchronization of the cycle in different parts of Canada for at least 100 years, its parallel occurrence both west and east of the Rockies, and its independent occurrence in aquatic species such as the muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) and the salmon (Salmo salar), strongly suggest the existence of a climatic factor partly controlling it.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite a long tradition in plant ecology of studies of patch dynamics, recent developments of models for large scale dynamics in source-sink and metapopulations have largely focused on animals. In contrast to mobile unitary animals, many plants resist extinction, even under conditions where only a part of the life cycle can be maintained. This model of remnant population dynamics adds to the two commonly recognized source-sink and metapopulations dynamics. A review of the literature suggests that all three types of dynamics are common in plants. Regional dynamics are related to life-cycle characteristics determining dispersal ability and longevity of life cycle stages. Short-lived or highly habitat specialized plants with good dispersal tend to build up metapopulations, i.e. systems of local populations and non-occupied but potentially suitable sites, interconnected with dispersal, and in a continuous flux of local colonization and extinction. At the other extreme, long-lived plants with clonal propagation, or plants with extensive seed banks, tend to build up remnant population systems, in which many local populations persist over periods long enough to bridge unfavourable phases of successional development, intervening periods of favourable conditions. Source-sink populations are a special case of metapopulations, in the sense that they comprise both persistent refuge populations and ephemeral populations maintained by dispersal. It is suggested that a concept of local population inertia in remnant population systems, scales to higher level phenomena of vegetation inertia, and to community stabilization (through enhanced recovery after perturbations). Such an inertia may contribute to explain cases of exceptionally high species diversity, and lack of pronounced mass extinctions of plants in the fossil record.},

  Abstract                 = {Demographic stochasticity is almost universally modeled as sampling variance in a homogeneous population, although it is defined as arising from random variation among individuals. This can lead to serious misestimation of the extinction risk in small populations. Here, we derive analytical expressions showing that the misestimation for each demographic parameter is exactly (in the case of survival) or approximately (in the case of fecundity) proportional to the among-individual variance in that parameter. We also show why this misestimation depends on systematic variation among individuals, rather than random variation. These results indicate that correctly assessing the importance of demographic stochasticity requires (1) an estimate of the variance in each demographic parameter; (2) information on the qualitative shape (convex or concave) of the mean-variance relationship; and (3) information on the mechanisms generating among-individual variation. An important consequence is that almost all population viability analyses (PVAs) overestimate the importance of demographic stochasticity and, therefore, the risk of extinction.},

  Abstract                 = {Population biologists have long been interested in the oscillations in population size displayed by many organisms in the field and laboratory. A wide range of deterministic mathematical models predict that these fluctuations can be generated internally by nonlinear interactions among species and, if correct, would provide important insights for understanding and predicting the dynamics of interacting populations. We studied the dynamical behavior of a two-species aquatic laboratory community encompassing the interactions between a demographically structured herbivore population, a primary producer, and a mineral resource, yet still amenable to description and parameterization using a mathematical model. The qualitative dynamical behavior of our experimental system, that is, cycles, equilibria, and extinction, is highly predictable by a simple nonlinear model.},

  Abstract                 = {Arguments regarding the appropriate form for the rate at which consumers extract biomass from resource populations hinge on relative time scales of underlying processes. Some ecologists argue that, because differential equation models imply instantaneous rates of change, time scale arguments do not hold. Here we point out that this reasoning is fallacious. We define three natural time scales for consumer-resource interactions and demonstrate, using asymptotic methods of analysis, how relative differences in these scales lead to the formulation of models with qualitatively distinct dynamics. Further, we identify time scale and resource heterogeneity assumptions that constrain the R~* competition rule (i.e., the competitor that suppresses theresource to the lowest density excludes all other competitors), as well as clarify the dichotomy between Schoener's models of competition for overlapping and for partitioned resources.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that solutions to linear first-order stochastic difference equations with stationary autocorrelated coefficients converge weakly in D[0,1] to an It{\^o} stochastic integral plus a correction term when the time scale is shifted so that the means, variances, and covariances of the coefficients all approach zero at the same rate. Other limit theorems applicable to different time scale shifts are also given. These results yield two different continuous time limits to a recent model of Roughgarden (1975) for population growth in stationary random environments. One limit, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, is applicable in the presence of rapidly fluctuating autocorrelated environments; the other limit, which is not a diffusion process, applies to the case of slowly varying, highly autocorrelated environments. Other applications in population biology and genetics are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Many species are distributed into "metapopulations", consisting of many ephemeral local populations in partially isolated patches of habitat. Metapopulation models have generally ignored correlation among environmental conditions in constituent populations. The effects of environmental correlation in the probability of extinction on the persistence times of finite metapopulations are examined, using a computer simulation. When the means and variances of the subpopulation extinction probabilities are both high (e.g. 0.25), temporal environmental correlation among populations may greatly reduce the average time to metapopulation extinction, especially for large metapopulations. However, when the extinction rate and/or its variance take on low to moderate values, even complete correlation in probabilities of extinction among populations may lead to relatively little diminution in global persistence time.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the dynamical effects of spatial heterogeneity in host-parasitoid interactions with discrete generations. We show that the dynamical effects of any pattern of distribution of searching parasitoids in such systems can be assessed within a common, simple framework. In particular, we describe an approximate general rule that the populations of hosts and parasitoids will be regulated if the coefficient of variation squared (CV$^{2}$) of the distribution of searching parasitoids is greater than one. This criterion is shown to apply both generally and in several specific cases. We further show that CV$^{2}$ may be partitioned into a density-dependent component (direct or inverse) caused by the response of parasitoids to host density per patch, and a density independent component. Population regulation can be enhanced as much by density independent as by density-dependent heterogeneity. Thus the dynamical effects of any pattern of distribution of searching parasitoids can be assessed within the same common framework. The paradoxical impact of density-independent heterogeneity on dynamics is especially interesting: the greater the density independence, and thus the more scattered the data of percent parasitism against local host density, the more stable the populations are likely to be. Although a detailed analysis of host-parasitoid interactions in continuous time has yet to be done, evidence does not support the suggestion of Murdoch & Oaten (1989) that non-random parasitism may have quite different effects on the dynamics of continuous-time interactions. There appears to be no fundamental difference in the role of heterogeneity in comparable discrete- or continuous-time interactions. A total of 65 data sets from field studies have been analysed, in which percentage parasitism in relation to local host density have been recorded. In each case, estimated values of CV$^{2}$ have been obtained by using a maximum likelihood procedure. The method also allows us to partition the CV$^{2}$ into the density dependent and density-independent components mentioned above. In 18 out of the 65 cases, total heterogeneity was at levels sufficient (if typical of the interactions) to stabilize the interacting populations (i.e. CV$^{2}$ > 1). Interestingly, in 14 of these it is the host-density-independent heterogeneity that contributes most to the total heterogeneity. Although heterogeneity has often been regarded as a complicating factor in population dynamics that rapidly leads to analytical intractability, this clearly need not necessarily be so. The CV$^{2}$ > 1 rule explains the consequences of heterogeneity for population dynamics in terms of a simple description of the heterogeneity itself, and provides a rough rule for predicting the effects of different kinds of heterogeneity on population regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of interacting structured populations can be modeled by $\frac{dx_i}{dt}= A_i (x)x_i$ where $x_i\in \R^{n_i}$, $x=(x_1,\dots,x_k)$, and $A_i(x)$ are matrices with non-negative off-diagonal entries. These models are permanent if there exists a positive global attractor and are robustly permanent if they remain permanent following perturbations of $A_i(x)$. Necessary and sufficient conditions for robust permanence are derived using dominant Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_i(\mu)$ of the $A_i(x)$ with respect to invariant measures $\mu$. The necessary condition requires $\max_i \lambda_i(\mu)>0$ for all ergodic measures with support in the boundary of the non-negative cone. The sufficient condition requires that the boundary admits a Morse decomposition such that $\max_i \lambda_i(\mu)>0$ for all invariant measures $\mu$ supported by a component of the Morse decomposition. When the Morse components are Axiom A, uniquely ergodic, or support all but one population, the necessary and sufficient conditions are equivalent. Applications to spatial ecology, epidemiology, and gene networks are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological vector fields \dot x_i = x_if_i(x) on the non-negative cone \hbox{\bf R}^n_+ on Rn are often used to describe the dynamics of n interacting species. These vector fields are called permanent (or uniformly persistent) if the boundary \partial {\bf R}^n_+ of the non-negative cone is repelling. We construct an open set of ecological vector fields containing a dense subset of permanent vector fields and containing a dense subset of vector fields with attractors on \partial {\bf R}^n_+ . In particular, this construction implies that robustly permanent vector fields are not dense in the space of permanent vector fields. Hence, verifying robust permanence is important. We illustrate this result with ecological vector fields involving five species that admit a heteroclinic cycle between two equilibria and the Hastings Powell teacup attractor. !!},

  Abstract                 = {1. The relationship between temporal variability, spectral redness and population persistence for a large number of long-term time series was investigated. Although both intuition and theory suggest that more variability in population abundance would mean greater probability of extinction, previous empirical support for this view has not been conclusive. Possible reasons are the shortage of long-term data and the difficulties of adequately characterizing temporal variability, two issues that are explicitly addressed in this paper. 2. We examined the relationship between population variability and quasi-extinction time (measured as the time required to observe a 90% decline of population abundance) for a large set of data comprising 554 populations for 123 species that were censused for more than 30 years. Two aspects of temporal variability were considered in relation with the quasi-extinction time: a baseline value (coefficient of variation over a fixed, 30-year, time scale), and a measure of the rate of increase of the population variability over time (spectral exponent). 3. The results show that the quasi-extinction time was shorter for populations having higher temporal variability and redder dynamics. The relation between persistence time and population variability was compared for different taxa, trophic levels, habitat type (aquatic and terrestrial) and body sizes and compared with theoretical expectations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops mathematical and statistical techniques for measuring the resilience of inherently stochastic ecological systems. To correspond to the deterministic idea of resilience measured by the return time to equilibrium following perturbation, resilience in stochastic systems is defined as the variability in population densities relative to environmentally driven variability in population growth rates. Stochastic resilience defined in this way is calculated from a community matrix describing the average interaction strengths within and among species. The procedure to calculate stochastic resilience is demonstrated on simulated data sets consisting of time series of population densities. The simplicity of the procedure makes it a potential tool for application to a wide range of ecological communities.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the effects of fire on population growth rate and invasive spread of the perennial tussock grass Molinia caerulea. During the last decades, this species has invaded heathland communities in Western Europe, replacing typical heathland species such as Calluna vulgaris and Erica tetralix. M. caerulea is considered a major threat to heathland conservation. In 1996, a large and unintended fire destroyed almost one-third of the Kalmthoutse Heide, a large heathland area in northern Belgium. To study the impact of this fire on the population dynamics and invasive spread of M. caerulea, permanent monitoring plots were established both in burned and unburned heathland. The fate of each M. caerulea individual in these plots was monitored over four years (1997-2000). Patterns of seed dispersal were inferred from a seed germination experiment using soil cores sampled one month after seed rain at different distances from seed-producing plants. Based on these measures, we calculated projected rates of spread for M. caerulea in burned and unburned heathland. Elasticity and sensitivity analyses were used to determine vital rates that contributed most to population growth rate, and invasion speed. Invasion speed was, on average, three times larger in burned compared to unburned plots. Dispersal distances on the other hand, were not significantly different between burned and unburned plots indicating that differences in invasive spread were mainly due to differences in demography. Elasticities for fecundity and growth of seedlings and juveniles were higher for burned than for unburned plots, whereas elasticities for survival were higher in unburned plots. Finally, a life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis revealed that the effect of fire was mainly contributed by increases in sexual reproduction (seed production and germination) and growth of seedlings and juveniles. Our results clearly showed increased invasive spread of M. caerulea after fire, and call for active management guidelines to prevent further encroachment of the species and to reduce the probability of large, accidental fires in the future. Mowing of resprouted plants before flowering is the obvious management tactic to halt massive invasive spread of the species after fire.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding biological invasions requires information on the history of spatial spread, as well as measures of landscape and biotic features that control habitat invasibility. Because invasive species often spread quickly over large areas, attaining these two sets of information simultaneously is uncommon. We studied the spread of a fatal nonnative root pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis, across a heterogeneous landscape of its host, Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana). Within our $37-km^{2}$ study area in southwestern Oregon and northwest California, Port Orford cedar populations are generally restricted to riparian zones along creeks. The pathogen is spread between watersheds in two ways: (1) by spore-infested material being dislodged from vehicles, and (2) by animals or people moving infested mud (i.e., via foot traffic). Using dendrochronological techniques, we determined the date of infection for dead cedars and reconstructed spread history across our study area from 1977 to 1999. Twenty-six of the 36 (72%) separate infection events we identified were caused by dispersal via vehicles along roads, and the remainder by foot traffic. Survival analysis demonstrated that cedar populations in creeks crossed by roads were more likely to be infected than those creeks that were not crossed by roads. Also, a comparison of minimum dispersal distances showed infections that moved via road moved significantly farther than those vectored by foot traffic, and the distance infection traveled declined significantly through time. We also coupled our spread history with measures of landscape and host features, including abundance of potential host trees, the distance from the road surface to the nearest potential host, length of road in immediate contact with the riparian zone, catchment area (a measure of stream flow), elevation, slope, and solar radiation. Our results show that catchment area, host abundance, and proximity to the nearest tree are significantly and positively associated with infection risk. Our study demonstrates that increased connectivity between invasible sites created by the presence of roads can increase invasion success of a plant pathogen. We also document that successful pathogen invasion can be governed by both physical landscape features and attributes of host plant populations.},

  Abstract                 = {(1) A method of analysis is proposed to test whether differences in survivorship of a given species among two or more habitats are the result of variation among the habitats in environmental factors (density-independent effects), or in species density (density-dependent effects). (2) The method requires that a range of seed densities of the species be sown in a given habitat, and survivorship and reproductive output measured for each sowing density. If a straight line with negative slope can be fitted to the survivorship v. sowing density relationship, then the survivorship y-intercept of the line is an estimate of density-independent mortality, and the slope is an estimate of the density dependence of mortality. (3) If this analysis is carried out for the species growing in several habitats, it is possible to test whether intercepts or slopes (and consequently density-independent or density-dependent effects) differ among habitats. A similar analysis can be carried out for reproductive output. (4) The annual plant Cakile edentula, a common species on sand dunes in eastern North America, is used as an example. Three experimental sites along a sand-dune gradient were each sown with seeds at a range of densities and survivorship and reproductive output measured for each density at each site. (5) The density dependence of survivorship changed significantly ( $P < 0.001$ ) along the gradient (among habitats), whereas density-independent mortality stayed constant. (6) Significant differences ( $P < 0.001$ ) were observed for both density-independent and density-dependent effects on reproductive output. (7) The effects of density on survivorship were greatest at the landward end of the gradient, whereas the effects of density on reproductive output were greatest at the seaward end.},

  Abstract                 = { abstract: All species' ranges are the result of successful past invasions. Thus, models of species' invasions and their failure can provide insight into the formation of a species' geographic range. Here, we study the properties of invasion models when a species cannot persist below a critical population density known as an Allee threshold. In both spatially continuous reaction-diffusion models and spatially discrete coupled ordinary-differential-equation models, the Allee effect can cause an invasion to fail. In patchy landscapes (with dynamics described by the spatially discrete model), range limits caused by propagation failure (pinning) are stable over a wide range of parameters, whereas, in an uninterrupted habitat (with dynamics described by a spatially continuous model), the zero velocity solution is structurally unstable and thus unlikely to persist in nature. We derive conditions under which invasion waves are pinned in the discrete space model and discuss their implications for spatially complex dynamics, including critical phenomena, in ecological landscapes. Our results suggest caution when interpreting abrupt range limits as stemming either from competition between species or a hard environmental limit that cannot be crossed: under a wide range of plausible ecological conditions, species' ranges may be limited by an Allee effect. Several example systems appear to fit our general model. },

  Abstract                 = {To better understand the evolution of dispersal in spatially heterogeneous landscapes, we study difference equation models of populations that reproduce and disperse in a landscape consisting of k patches. The connectivity of the patches and costs of dispersal are determined by a k x k column substochastic matrix S, where Sij represents the fraction of dispersing individuals from patch j that end up in patch i. Given S, a dispersal strategy is a k x 1 vector whose ith entry gives the probability pi that individuals disperse from patch i. If all of the pi's are the same, then the dispersal strategy is called unconditional; otherwise it is called conditional. For two competing populations of unconditional dispersers, we prove that the slower dispersing population (i.e., the population with the smaller dispersal probability) displaces the faster dispersing population. Alternatively, for populations of conditional dispersers without any dispersal costs (i.e., S is column stochastic and all patches can support a population), we prove that there is a one parameter family of strategies that resists invasion attempts by all other strategies.!!},

  Abstract                 = {To address the contentious issue of multiple parasitoid introductions in classical biological control, a discrete-time model of multiparasitoid-host interactions that accounts for host density-dependence and egg limitation is introduced and analyzed. For parasitoids that are egg-limited but not search-limited, the model is proven to exhibit four types of dynamics: host failure in which the host goes extinct in the presence or absence of the parasitoids, parasitoid driven extinction in which the parasitoid complex invariably drives the host extinct, host persistence, and conditional host persistence in which depending on the initial ratios of host to parasitoid densities the host is either driven extinct or persists. In the case of host persistence, the dynamics of the system are shown to be asymptotic to the dynamics of an appropriately defined one-dimensional difference equation. The results illustrate how the establishment of one or more parasitoids can facilitate the invasion of another parasitoid and how a complex of parasitoids can drive a host extinct despite every species in the complex being unable to do so. The effects of including search limitation are also explored.},

  Abstract                 = {Models that describe the spread of invading organisms often assume that the dispersal distances of propagules are normally distributed. In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading population is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat-tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant-speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction-diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial threshold in order to invade successfully. Fat-tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions.}

  Abstract                 = {To describe the dynamics of stage-structured populations with m stages living in n patches, we consider matrix models of the form SD, where S is a block diagonal matrix with n x n column substochastic matrices S1,..., Sm along the diagonal and D is a block matrix whose blocks are n x n nonnegative diagonal matrices. The matrix S describes movement between patches and the matrix D describes growth and reproduction within the patches. Consider the multiple arc directed graph G consisting of the directed graphs corresponding to the matrices S1,..., Sm, where each directed graph is drawn in a different color. We say G has a polychromatic cycle if G has a directed cycle that includes arcs of more than one color. We prove that p(SD) < p(D) for all block matrices D with nonnegative diagonal blocks if and only if G has no polychromatic cycle. Applications to ecological models are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Various biophysical systems exhibit characteristics of metapopulation and network structure. The specific type of metapopulation or network structure can have substantially different effects on metapopulation dynamics of marine species with open populations displaying varying degrees of connectivity between subpopulations, and thus can have major consequences on stock enhancement efforts. We investigate the role of connectivity in metapopulation dynamics of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, with three dimensional hydrodynamic models simulating advection and diffusion. In the case of the blue crab, we model a metapopulation comprised of primary (i.e. seagrass beds) and secondary (i.e. salt marsh fringed coves and shorelines) nursery habitats, and spatially distinct spawning grounds connected via migration corridors. In the model simulations, we distinguish nursery habitats that are recruitment limited, and therefore optimal candidates for stock enhancement through release of hatchery-reared or translocated juveniles. In the case of the Eastern oyster, we model connectivity between numerous oyster reefs (i.e., subpopulations) positioned according to historical observations. Model simulations produce estimates of the degree of connectivity between all pairs of oyster reefs, which subsequently permits assessment of the diversity of patterns in network connectivity. From these results we distinguish the major characteristic types of connectivity patterns among oyster reefs, we identify those reefs most suitable for broodstock enhancement, and we discuss the means by which oyster reef networks, such as those occurring throughout Chesapeake Bay, may be enhanced successfully.},

  Abstract                 = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous `superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency. !!},

  Abstract                 = {It is common practice in disease modeling studies to characterize groups or subgroups using population-average parameters, most importantly the basic reproductive number, R0 . This approach overlooks variation at the individual level, which is caused by many factors. In this paper we show evidence of significant individual-level variation in transmission patterns for several diseases, and discuss how this can be incorporated into epidemiological models. We introduce a natural generalization of R0 : the `individual reproductive number', v, which is the expected number of secondary cases caused by a given infected individual. Individual reproductive numbers for a population are drawn from a continuous probability distribution with mean equal to R0 (or to the effective reproductive number, R, if the population is not wholly susceptible). In this framework, superspreading events correspond to extreme values from the right-hand tail of the distribution of v, and we propose a precise and generalizable definition of superspreading events based on probabilistic considerations. We analyze detailed transmission data for a range of directly-transmitted diseases, and find that conventional models assuming homogeneous transmission cannot account for observed patterns. Analysis of a branching process model incorporating individual-level heterogeneity reveals that observed levels of variation cause invasion dynamics to differ dramatically from predictions based on population averages. We explore the implications of these findings for outbreak control policies, demonstrating that individual-specific control measures are more likely to stop an outbreak than population-wide measures when both have the same effect on R0 . We also highlight the effectiveness of measures targeting highly infectious individuals, and discuss how our results relate to recently-proposed surveillance methods for emerging diseases. We conclude by discussing future challenges in empirical and theoretical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the assumption that each trophic level acts as a single exploitative population, a model relating the trophic structure of ecosystems to their potential primary productivity is developed. According to the model, herbivory pressure should be most severe in relatively unproductive environments. With increased potential productivity, the role of predation in herbivore regulation should become more important and the impact of herbivory upon plant communities should decrease. In very productive environments, increase in herbivory pressure is again probable, at least in aquatic ecosystems. The predicted pattern of phytomass and predicted results of manipulations are compared with available data. A reasonable fit between predictions and observations is found, although the sparsity of data and methodological uncertainties weaken the corroboration in several cases. In terrestrial ecosystems, the present version of the model seems best applicable to the vertebrate branch of the grazing chain, whereas the arthropod branch may be more sensitive to temperature than to average annual productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary ecologists and population biologists have recently considered that ecological and evolutionary changes are intimately linked and can occur on the same time-scale. Recent theoretical developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity. This special feature about 'eco-evolutionary dynamics' brings together biologists from empirical and theoretical backgrounds to bridge the gap between ecology and evolution and provide a series of contributions aimed at quantifying the interactions between these fundamental processes.},

  Annote                   = {In the first half of the past century, empirical studies pointed out the importance of genetic changes as a cause of population fluctuations. But the incorporation of evolutionary dynamics in models of ecological dynamics has been largely ignored. David Pimentel was the first in trying to formalize mathematically the interaction between changes in gene frequency and changes in population size. In this paper he focused analytically on a plant-herbivore system in which prey evolution causes stable or oscillatory predator dynamics, whereas unstable outbreak dynamics is the outcome of the model without evolution. Pimentel and colleagues published the first experimental evidence of evolutionary change directly influencing community dynamics in a series of experiments with houseflies and parasitoid wasps (Space-time structure of the environment and the survival of parasite-host systems, 1963). They demonstrate that evolution towards increased resistance in the host and towards reduced virulence in the parasitoid decisively influenced the community dynamics. Although the techniques for genetic characterization did not exist at the time, they showed that evolution can lead to a dynamical stabilization of a two-species community in laboratory populations. Fussmann and collegues wrote a recent review of theoretical and empirical studies in which evolutionary processes significantly affect the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems (Eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities and ecosystems, 2007). They review instances where rapid evolutionary processes interact with population dynamics. "The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities." The study of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological processes has been broadened under the banner of community genetics (see Whitham et. al., Community and ecosystem genetics: a consequence of the extended phenotype, 2003; Neuhauser et. al., Community genetics: expanding the synthesis of ecology and genetics, 2003). The starting point is that changes in genotype frequency results in a change in the phenotypic traits that crucially affect interaction strength among populations, and therefore influence community dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Irregular fluctuations observed in natural population densities were traditionally attributed to external random influences such as climatic factors. That these may, in contrast, be the result of intrinsic nonlinearities, present even in very simple deterministic models, was first mooted by May. Since then, `chaos' has been shown to occur naturally in many fields of biology, ranging from physiology to the behaviour of social insects. Ecologists, however, still lack the ultimate proof of demonstrating conclusively the existence of chaotic population dynamics outside the world of equations and computer experiments. Further, it has been demonstrated that, in some population models exhibiting chaos via the perioddoubling route, a constant immigration factor inhibits the onset of chaos by a process called period reversal, prompting suggestions that chaos is fragile and easily inhibited. We present three classic host-parasitoid models, whose local stability properties have been extensively studied in the past, but whose chaotic dynamics have not previously been explored. We find that chaos in this class of models is reached via quasiperiodicity, a route not normally associated with population models, and is relatively robust against reasonably small levels of immigration. This leads us to conclude that chaos could persist in some natural populations, even in the presence of such external perturbations.},

  Abstract                 = {The functional importance of higher-order predators in terrestrial ecosystems is currently an area of active inquiry. In particular, an understanding of the relative influences of prey availability and higher-order predation on predator populations is of immediate relevance to the theory of biological control of herbivorous arthropods. Biological control workers have repeatedly speculated that one cause of failure to establish predators and parasitoids in novel environments is the strong mortality imposed on released agents by higher-order predators. Nevertheless, the ability of higher-order predators to create a habitat where mortality exceeds natality (a "sink" habitat) has never been tested experimentally with a biological control agent in nature. Although in isolation the predatory lacewing Chrysoperla carnea can consistently produce strong suppression of populations of the aphid Aphis gossypii, the full community of predators when tested together exerts minimal aphid control. The age structure of Chrysoperla spp. populations in cotton fields harboring low to intermediate densities of aphid prey is characterized by a sharp drop in densities from the egg to the first larval instar; this observation is consistent with heavy mortality during either the egg or first larval stage. Egg cohorts followed under unmanipulated field conditions showed relatively high rates of successful hatch, suggesting that the vulnerable developmental stage is the young larva. Larval survival is relatively high in the absence of hemipteran predators, suggesting that prey availability is not the primary limiting factor. Depressed survival is observed in the presence of Geocoris spp., Nabis spp., and Zelus renardii, all common hemipteran predators in cotton. Predation on lacewing larvae appears to disrupt the strong top-down control of aphid populations in cotton. Chrysoperla spp. densities declined in fields harboring intermediate aphid densities when lacewing subpopulations were experimentally caged to block immigration and emigration. In one year (1993) Chrysoperla spp. densities fell to very low levels, suggesting that the field was either a true sink habitat or a pseudosink with a very low equilibrium density. In a second year (1994), densities declined to what appeared to be a lower but stable density, suggesting that the habitat was a pseudosink. Thus, in both years, declines in Chrysoperla spp. densities were observed following caging, suggesting that Chrysoperla spp. populations are spatially subsidized. Aphid prey availability and higher-order predation interacted strongly in their influence on C. carnea survival: larval survival in the presence of higher-order predators was 5.6% when prey availability was intermediate and 40.5% when prey were superabundant. Spatial heterogeneity in aphid prey densities modulates the intensity of higher-order predation and thereby appears to produce source-sink dynamics of Chrysoperla spp. in cotton fields.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A linear model for population dynamics in stochastic environments is introduced by linearizing the logistic equation in discrete time for small stochastic variations around a large average carrying capacity. The analysis of this model involves the relatively simple mathematics of time-series analysis and is not restricted to white noise (i.e., totally unpredictable) environments. 2. In this linear model the population size at any time is a reflection of many historical effects. The intrinsic rate of increase, r, is a measure of the responsiveness of the population to changes in k. A responsive population (r ??? 1) does not retain historical effects for long, whereas a sluggish population (r ??? 0) does. 3. The variance of the population size through time always increases with r. But the presence of much predictability in the environment, as measured by the serial correlation between consecutive values of K, reduces the influence of r. High serial correlation allows time for even a sluggish population to achieve an N near the current K thereby causing the population variance to nearly equal the carrying-capacity variance. 4. The predictability of the population size is in general a reflection of both its responsiveness to changes in K and the predictability of K itself. However if the population is perfectly responsive (r = 1), then its predictability becomes a direct expression of the predictability of K. Conversely, if K is unpredictable then the predictability of the population depends solely on its own responsiveness. Except in these special cases, the population's predictability depends on both factors. 5. The temporal pattern of the population size depends on the population's responsiveness and on the temporal pattern of the carrying capacity. If r < 1 then the population pattern preferentially represents the long-term components present within the carrying-capacity pattern, if r = 1 no component is preferentially represented, and if r > 1 the short-term components are preferentially represented. The population's temporal pattern is "connected" to the carrying-capacity's temporal pattern through a "filter" whose frequency characteristics are set by r. 6. The linear model and logistic model were compared through computer simulation. In the logistic, but not the linear, model deviations of N above K are restored more strongly than deviations of N below K. As a result the population size from the logistic model was invariably slightly lower than in the linear model, and the logistic population variance was slightly higher. 7. The predictions about the serial correlation between consecutive population sizes which were derived analytically from the linear model were checked with computer simulations on the logistic model. When the coefficient of variation (CV) of K was 5%, the differences between the models were not detectable with even 1,000 census points. When the CV was 15%, provided population extinction did not occur, the differences again were not detectable with 1,000 points. 8. Population extinction due to a fluctuating K is shown to be related to two issues: the change in K may be translated into a perturbation to N and the perturbation to N may be restored. The responsiveness of the population is the parameter relevant to the first issue and the rate of return to equilibrium following a perturbation is the parameter relating to the second.}

The reverse--how evolutionary dynamics affect ecological traits--has only recently captured our attention, however, with the realization that evolution can occur over ecological time scales. This newly highlighted causal direction and the implied feedback loop--eco-evolutionary dynamics--is invigorating both ecologists and evolutionists and blurring the distinction between them. Despite some recent relevant studies, the importance of the evolution-to-ecology pathway across systems is still unknown. Only an extensive research effort involving multiple experimental approaches-particularly long-term field experiments--over a variety of ecological communities will provide the answer.},

Short-term survival was greater on islands without than with predators; area had no effect. Spiders initially increased substantially on both groups of islands without lizards, but after 5 years they nearly died off on small islands while persisting on most large islands; populations in the presence of predators never increased above initial sizes. Results show how predators as well as area are important in determining invasion success.},

  Abstract                 = {It is an ecological truism that population persistence depends on a population's growth rate when rare. To understand the interplay between temporal correlations, spatial heterogeneity, and dispersal on persistence, an analytic approximation for this growth rate is derived for partially mixing populations. Partial mixing has two effects on population growth. In the absence of temporal correlations in relative fitness, greater movement to patches with, on average, higher relative fitness increases population growth rates. In the absence of spatial heterogeneity in the average relative fitnesses, lower dispersal rates enhance growth rates when temporal correlations of relative fitness within a patch exceed temporal correlations in relative fitness between different patches. This approximation implies that metapopulations whose expected fitness in every patch is less than one can persist if there are positive temporal correlations in relative fitness, sufficiently weak spatial correlations, and sufficiently low dispersal rates. It also implies that movement into lower-quality habitats is optimal whenever the net variation in per-capita growth rates is sufficiently larger than the mean difference in per-capita growth rates. Moreover, temporal correlations, whether they be negative or positive, can enhance population growth for optimal dispersal rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously, we have show that the co-evolution of patch selection strategies of hosts and parasitoids in heterogeneous environments can lead to contrary habitat choices in which the hosts preferentially select patches that the parasitoids avoid. Since this work did not include the variable parasitoid sex ratios that have been found in field and laboratory systems with contrary choices, we extend previous analyses to determine how parasitoid sex allocation co-evolves with host and parasitoid patch preferences. In our analysis, we assume the environment consists of two patch types: lower quality patches and higher quality patches. In the lower quality patches, hosts have a lower intrinsic rate of growth and female parasitoid larvae are less likely to survive than male parasitoid larvae. Our co-evolutionary analysis reveals that the co-evolved parasitoids preferentially search for hosts in higher quality patches, lay primarily female eggs on hosts encountered in these patches, and are more likely to lay male eggs on hosts encountered in the lower quality patches. As a co-evolutionary response, the hosts lay twice as many eggs in the poorer patches as they would if parasitoid sex ratios did not evolve. We conclude by showing that the co-evolution of parasitoid sex allocation with patch selection can stabilize host-parasitoid interactions even when co-evolution of patch selection by itself does not.!!},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate patch selection strategies of hosts and parasitoids in heterogeneous environments. Previous theoretical work showed that when host traits vary among patches, coevolved populations of hosts and parasitoids make congruent choices (i.e.,hosts and parasitoids preferentially select the same patches) and exhibit direct density dependence in the distribution of percent parasitism. However, host-parasitoid systems in the field show a range of patterns in percent parasitism, while behavioral studies indicate that hosts and parasitoids can exhibit contrary choices (i.e., hosts avoid parches favored by the parasitoid). We extend previous theory by permitting life-history traits of the parasitoid as well as the host to vary among patches. Our analysis implies that in coevolutionarily stable populations, hosts preferentially select patches that intrinsically support higher host equilibrium numbers (i.e., the equilibrium number achieved by hosts when both populations are confined toa single patch) and that parasitoids preferentially select patches that intrinsically support higher parasitoid equilibrium numbers (i.e., the equilibrium number achieved by the parasitoids when both populations are confined to a patch). Using this result, we show how variation in life-history traits among patches leads to contrary or congruent choices or leads to direct density dependence, inverse density dependence, or density independence in the distribution of percent parasitism. In addition, we determine when populations playing the coevolutionarily stable strategies are ecologically stable. Our analysis shows that heterogeneous environments containing patches where the intrinsic rate of growth of the host and the survivorship rate ofthe parasitoid are low result in the coevolved populations exhibiting contrary choices and, as a result, promote ecological stability.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological invasions, including infectious disease outbreaks and biocontrol introductions, often involve small numbers of individuals arriving in spatially heterogeneous environments. Small numbers lead to demographic stochasticity, and spatial heterogeneity means that establishment success depends critically on the introduction sites and movement patterns of invaders. We present a general stochastic modeling framework to address how spatial heterogeneity and movement patterns determine establishment success, population growth, and rates of spatial spread. For dispersal-limited populations, our analysis reveals that spatial heterogeneity increases the expected population growth rate and that local reproductive numbers determine establishment success. Higher dispersal rates decrease the expected population growth rate, but can enhance establishment success, particularly when movement patterns are positively correlated with local reproductive numbers. We also find that several small, randomly distributed propagules of invaders are more likely to succeed than a single large propagule. Even if invasions are ultimately successful, there may be substantial time lags before an invader reaches observable densities. These time lags are longer for invasions into patches where extinction risk is high and in landscapes where metapopulation-scale population growth rate is low, while the opposite holds true for rates of spatial spread. Sensitivity analysis of our models provides guidance for control efforts.!!},

  Abstract                 = {Predators often have type II functional responses and live in environments where their life history traits as well as those of their prey vary from patch to patch. To understand how spatial heterogeneity and predator handling times influence the coevolution of patch preferences and ecological stability, we perform an ecological and evolutionary analysis of a Nicholson-Bailey type model. We prove that coevolutionarily stable prey and searching predators prefer patches that in isolation support higher prey and searching predator densities, respectively. Using this fact, we determine how environmental variation and predator handling times influence the spatial patterns of patch preferences, population abundances and per-capita predation rates. In particular, long predator handling times are shown to result in the coevolution of predator and prey aggregation. An analytic expression characterizing ecological stability of the coevolved populations is derived. This expression implies that contrary to traditional theoretical expectations, predator handling time can stabilize predator-prey interactions through its coevolutionary influence on patch preferences. These results are shown to have important implications for classical biological control. !!},

Applications to evolutionary bimatrix games and uniform persistence are given. In particular, it shown that random perturbations of evolutionary bimatrix game dynamics result in almost sure extinction of one or more strategies.!!},

  Abstract                 = {There is an emerging consensus that parasitoids are limited by the number of eggs which they can lay as well as the amount of time they can search for their hosts. Since egg limitation tends to destabilize host-parasitoid dynamics, successful control of insect pests by parasitoids requires additional stabilizing mechanisms such as heterogeneity in the distribution of parasitoid attacks and host density-dependence. To better understand how egg limitation, search limitation, heterogeneity in parasitoid attacks, and host density-dependence influence host-parasitoid dynamics, discrete time models accounting for these factors are analyzed. When parasitoids are purely egg-limited, a complete anaylsis of the host-parasitoid dynamics are possible. The analysis implies that the parasitoid can invade the host system only if the parasitoid's intrinsic fitness exceeds the host's intrinsic fitness. When the parasitoid can invade, there is a critical threshold, CV*>1, of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the distribution of parasitoid attacks that determines that outcome of the invasion. If parasitoid attacks sufficiently aggregated (i.e., CV>CV*), then the host and parasitoid coexist. Typically (in a topological sense), this coexistence is shown to occur about a periodic attractor or a stable equilibrium. If the parasitoid attacks are sufficiently random (i.e. CV<CV*), then the parasitoid drives the host to extinction. When parasitoids are weakly search-limited as well as egg-limited, coexistence about a global attractor occurs even if CV<CV*. However, numerical simulations suggest that the nature of this attractor depends critically on whether CV<1 or CV>1. When CV<1, the parasitoid exhibits highly oscillatory dynamics. Alternatively, when parasitoid attacks are sufficiently aggregated but not overly aggregated (i.e. CV>1 but close to 1), the host and parasitoid coexist about a stable equilibrium with low host densities. The implications of these results for classical biological control are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A discrete-time host-parasitoid model including host-density dependence and a generalized Thompson escape function is analyzed. This model assumes that parasitoids are egg-limited but not search-limited, and is proven to exhibit five types of dynamics: host failure in which the host goes extinct in the parasitoid's presence or absence, unconditional parasitoid failure in which the parasitoid always goes extinct while the host persists, conditional parasitoid failure in the host and the parasitoid go extinct or coexist depending on the initial host-parasitoid ratio, parasitoid driven extinction in which the parasitoid invariably drives the host to extinction, and coexistence in which the host and parasitoid coexist about a global attractor. The latter two dynamics only occur when the parasitoid's maximal rate of growth exceeds the host's maximal rate of growth. Moreover, coexistence requires parasitism events to be sufficiently aggregated. Small additive noise is proven to alter the dynamical outcomes in two ways. The addition of noise to parasitoid driven extinction results in random outbreaks of the host and parasitoid with varying intensity. Additive noise converts conditional parasitoid failure to unconditional parasitoid failure. Implications for classical biological control are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Two definitions of persistence despite perturbations in deterministic models are presented. The first definition, persistence despite frequent small perturbations, is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a positive attractor i.e. an attractor bounded away from extinction. The second definition, persistence despite rare large perturbations, is shown to be equivalent to permanence i.e. a positive attractor whose basin of attraction includes all positive states. Both definitions set up a natural dichotomy for classifying models of interacting populations. Namely, a model is either persistent despite perturbations or not. When it is not persistent, it follows that all initial conditions are prone to extinction due to perturbations of the appropriate type. For frequent small perturbations, this method of classification is shown to be generically robust: there is a dense set of models for which persistent (respectively, extinction prone) models lies within an open set of persistent (resp. extinction prone) models. For rare large perturbations, this method of classification is shown not to be generically robust. Namely, work of Josef Hofbauer and the author have shown there are open sets of ecological models containing a dense sets of permanent models and a dense set of extinction prone models. The merits and drawbacks of these different definitions are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Discrete time single species models with overcompensating density dependence and an Allee effect due to predator satiation and mating limitation are investigated. The models exhibit four behaviors: persistence for all initial population densities, bistability in which a population persists for intermediate initial densities and otherwise goes extinct, extinction for all initial densities, and essential extinction in which "almost every" initial density leads to extinction. For fast-growing populations, these models show populations can persist at high levels of predatimi even though lower levels of predation lead to essential extinction. Alternatively, increasing the predator's handling time, the population's carrying capacity, or the likelihood of mating success may lead to essential extinction. In each of these cases, the mechanism behind these disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical threshold determined by the Allee effect. These disappearances are proceeded by chaotic transients that are proven to be approximately exponentially distributed in length and highly sensitive to initial population densities.!!},

  Abstract                 = {A class of truncated unimodal discrete-time single species models for which low or high densities result in extinction in the following generation are considered. A classification of the dynamics of these maps into five types is proven: (i) extinction in finite time for all initial densities, (ii) semistability in which all orbits tend toward the origin or a semi-stable fixed point, (iii) bistability for which the origin and an interval bounded away from the origin are attracting, (iv) chaotic semistability in which there is an interval of chaotic dynamics whose compliment lies in the origin's basin of attraction and (v) essential extinction in which almost every (but not every) initial population density leads to extinction in finite time. Applying these results to the Logistic, Ricker and generalized Beverton-Holt maps with constant harvesting rates, two birfurcations are shown to lead to sudden population disappearances: a saddle node bifurcation corresponding to a transition from bistability to extinction and a chaotic blue sky catastrophe corresponding to a transition from bistability to essential extinction.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand the relative importance of natural selection and random genetic drift in finite but growing populations, the asymptotic behavior of a class of generalized Polya urns is studied using the method of ordinary differential equation (ODE). Of particular interest is the replicator process: two balls (individuals) are chosen from an urn (the population) at random with replacement and balls of the same colors (strategies) are added or removed according to probabilities that depend only on the colors of the chosen balls. Under the assumption that the expected number of balls being added always exceeds the expected number of balls being removed whenever balls are in the urn, the probability of nonextinction is shown to be positive. On the event of nonextinction, three results are proven: (i) the number of balls increases asymptotically at a linear rate, (ii) the distribution x(n) of strategies at the nth update is a "noisy" Cauchy--Euler approximation to the mean limit ODE of the process, and (iii) the limit set of x(n) is almost surely a connected internally chain recurrent set for the mean limit ODE. Under a stronger set of assumptions, it is shown that for any attractor of the mean limit ODE there is a positive probability that the limit set for x(n) lies in this attractor. Theoretical and numerical estimates for the probabilities of nonextinction and convergence to an attractor suggest that random genetic drift is more likely to overcome natural selection in small populations for which pairwise interactions lead to highly variable outcomes, and is less likely to overcome natural selection in large populations with the potential for rapid growth.},

vector field that generates a dissipative flow $\phi$ on the

boundary of the positive cone is repelling. $\phi$ is called {\em
$C^r$ robustly permanent} if $\phi$ remains permanent for
sufficiently small $C^r$ perturbations of the vector field. A
necessary condition and a sufficient condition for $C^r$ robust
permanence involving the average per-capita growth rates $\int f_i
d\mu$ with respect to invariant measures $\mu$ are derived. The
necessary condition requires that $\inf_\mu \max_i \int f_i
d\mu>0$ where the infimum is taken over ergodic measures with
compact support in the boundary of the positive cone. The
sufficient condition requires that the boundary flow admits a
Morse decomposition $\{M_1,\dots, M_k\}$ such that every $M_j$
satisfies $\min_\mu \max_i \int f_i d\mu >0$ where the minimum is
taken over invariant measures with support in $M_j$. As
applications, we provide a sufficient condition for $C^r$ robust

When this occurs, a repelling heteroclinic network on the boundary of the positive orthant is formed in which the removal of any predator leads to a system with a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium that only supports a single species.!!},

  Abstract                 = {General dynamic models of systems with two prey and one or two predators are considered. After rescaling the equations so that both prey have the same intrinsic rate of growth, it is shown that there exists a generalist predator that can mediate permanence if and only if there is a population density of a prey at which its per-capita growth rate is positive yet less than its competitor's invasion rate. In particular, this result implies that if the outcome of competition between the prey is independent of initial conditions, then there exists a generalist predator that mediates permanence. On the other hand, if the outcome of competition is contingent upon initial conditions (i.e., the prey are bistable), then there may not exist a suitable generalist predator. For example, bistable prey modeled by the Ayala--Gilpin (theta-Logistic) equations can be stabilized if and only if theta<1 for one of the prey. It is also shown that two specialist predators always can mediate permanence between bistable prey by creating a repelling heteroclinic cycle consisting of fixed points and limit cycles.},

For 1>b>0, it is shown that these models have a globally stable equilibrium. As a result, two conclusions can be drawn: (1) Consumer density dependence in the functional or in the per-capita numerical response can result in persistence of the consumer population in all containers. (2) In the absence of consumer density dependence, the consumer goes extinct in all containers except possibly the first. Several variations of this model are discussed including replacing discrete containers by a spatial continuum and introducing a dynamic resource.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding under what conditions interacting populations, whether they be plants, animals, or viral particles, coexist is a question of theoretical and practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this weighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any (ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is sufficient noise in the system (i.e. all population states are accessible), we show that the populations approach a unique positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time Lotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic diversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.!!},

  Abstract                 = {1. Species often compete for breeding sites in heterogeneous landscapes consisting of sources and sinks. To understand how the presence or absence of sink breeding sites influence ecological outcomes, we extend Pulliam's source--sink model to competing species.
2. In a homogeneous landscape consisting of source sites, we prove that one species, the 'superior' competitor, competitively excludes the other. Dominance is determined by a simple rule: the species that at equilibrium acquires new breeding sites at a faster rate dominates.
3. We prove that the inclusion of sink sites can alter this ecological outcome by either mediating coexistence, reversing competitive dominance, or facilitating a priority effect.
 4. Sink-mediated coexistence requires the species to exhibit asymmetries in acquiring sink sites, the 'inferior' species to have a competitive advantage on sink sites and the ratio of sink to source sites be sufficiently low.
 5. For example, if the sink breeding sites are competitive refuges for the 'inferior' competitor and not too low in quality, coexistence occurs if the number of sink sites lies below a threshold. Alternatively, when the number of sink sites exceeds this threshold, competitive dominance is reversed and the 'superior' competitor is displaced.
6. Counter-intuitively, despite being unable to support species in isolation, sink habitats embedded in a geographical mosaic of sources and sinks can enhance biodiversity by mediating coexistence or alter species composition by reversing competitive interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that enemy-victim interactions in spatially homogenous environments can exhibit diverging oscillations which result in the extinction of one or both species. For enemy-victim models with overlapping generations, we investigate the dynamical implications of spatial heterogeneity created by enemy-free sinks or victimless sinks. An enemy-free sink is a behavioral, physiological or ecological state that reduces or eliminates the victim's vulnerability to the enemy but cannot sustain the victim population. For victims that move in an ideal-free manner, we prove that the inclusion of an enemy-free sink shifts the population dynamics from diverging oscillations to stable oscillations. During these stable oscillations, the victim disperses in an oscillatory manner between the enemy-free sink and the enemy-occupied patch. Enemy-free sinks with lower mortality rates exhibit oscillations with smaller amplitudes and longer periods. A victimless sink, on the other hand, is a behavioral, physiological or ecological state in which the enemy has limited (or no) access to its victims. For enemies that move in an ideal-free manner, we prove that victimless sinks also stabilize diverging oscillations. Simulations suggest that suboptimal behavior due to information gathering or learning limitations amplify oscillations for systems with enemy-free sinks and dampen oscillations for systems with victimless sinks. These results illustrate that the coupling of a sink created by unstable enemy-victim interactions and a sink created by unsuitable environmental conditions can result in population persistence at the landscape level.},

To better understand the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we analyze a system consisting of two predators and two prey competing for a shared resource. We show how simple dominance rules (i.e. R and P rules) lead to cycling between sub-communities consisting of predator-prey pairs; predator and prey invasions alternatively lead to prey displacement via apparent competition and predator displacement via exploitative competition. We also show that these cycles are often dynamically unstable in the population phase space. More specifically, while for too slow invasion rates (i.e. sequential invasions) the system cycles indefinitely, faster invasion rates lead to coexistence of all species. In the later case, the assembly dynamics exhibit transient cycling between predator-prey subcommunities and the length of these transients decreases with the invasion rate and increases with habitat productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecosystems are often indirectly connected through consumers with complex life cycles (CLC), in which different life stages inhabit different ecosystems. Using a structured consumer resource model that accounts for the independent effects of two resources on consumer growth and reproductive rates, we show that such indirect connections between ecosystems can result in alternative stable states characterized by adult dominated and juvenile dominated consumer populations. As a consequence, gradual changes in ecosystem productivity or mortality rates of the consumer can lead to dramatic and abrupt regime shifts across different ecosystems, hysteresis, and counterintuitive changes in the consumer abundances. Whether these counter-intuitive or abrupt responses occur depend on the relative productivity of both habitats and which consumer life-stage inhabits the manipulated ecosystem. These results demonstrate the strong yet complex interactions between ecosystems coupled through consumers with CLC and the need to think across ecosystems to reliably predict the consequences of natural or anthropogenic changes. !!},

  Abstract                 = {We live in a time where climate models predict future increases in environmental variability and biological invasions are becoming increasingly frequent. A key to developing effective responses to biological invasions in increasingly variable environments will be estimates of their rates of spatial spread and the associated uncertainty of these estimates. Using stochastic, stage-structured, integro-difference equation models, we show analytically that invasion speeds are asymptotically normally distributed with a variance that decreases in time. We apply our methods to a simple juvenile-adult model with stochastic variation in reproduction and an illustrative example with published data for the perennial herb, \emph{Calathea ovandensis}. These examples buttressed by additional analysis reveal that increased variability in vital rates simultaneously slow down invasions yet generate greater uncertainty about rates of spatial spread. Moreover, while temporal autocorrelations in vital rates inflate variability in invasion speeds, the effect of these autocorrelations on the average invasion speed can be positive or negative depending on life history traits and how well vital rates ``remember'' the past.!!},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models of predator-prey interactions in a patchy landscape are used to explore the evolution of dispersal into sink habitats. When evolution is constrained to a single trophic level, three evolutionary outcomes are observed. If predator-prey dynamics are sufficiently stable in source habitats, then there is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) corresponding to sedentary phenotypes that specialize on source habitats. However, if predator-prey dynamics are sufficiently unstable in source habitats, then either an ESS corresponding to dispersive phenotypes utilizing both source and sink habitats or an evolutionary stable coalition (ESC) between dispersive and sedentary phenotypes emerges. ESCs only occur if dispersal into sink habitats can stabilize the predator-prey interactions. When evolution of dispersal proceeds at both trophic levels, nine evolutionary outcomes corresponding to any combination of specialists and generalists at one or both trophic levels were observed. Coevolution is largely top-down driven. If the predator mortality rate in sink habitats is low, then selection pressure for predator movement into sink habitats can forestall the evolution of prey sink populations. Alternatively, if this mortality rate is high, then the predators ultimately play a sedentary ESS. Only at intermediate predator mortality rates is there selection for predator and prey movement into sink habitats. These results suggest that the instability of predator-prey interactions may foster speciation near species borders. Moreover, they illustrate an evolutionary paradox of enrichment in which enriching source habitats can result in a loss of phenotypic diversity. !!},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of a consumer exploiting two resources is investigated. The strategy x under selection represents the fraction of time or energy an individual invests into extracting the first resource. In the model, a dimensionless parameter alpha quantifies how simultaneous consumption of both resources influences consumer growth; alpha<0 corresponds to hemi-essential resources, 0<alpha<1 corresponds to complementary resources, alpha=1 corresponds to perfectly substitutable resources, and alpha>1 corresponds to antagonistic resources. An analysis of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics leads to five conclusions. First, when alpha< or =1, there is a unique singular strategy x* for the adaptive dynamics and it is evolutionarily stable and globally convergent stable. Second, when alpha=1, the singular strategy x* corresponds to the populations exhibiting an ideal free distribution and a population playing this strategy can invade and displace populations playing any other strategy. Third, when alpha>1, the strategies x=0 and x=1 are evolutionarily stable and convergent stable. Hence, if the populations initially specialize on one resource, evolution amplifies this specialization. Fourth, when alpha is slightly larger than one (i.e. the resources are slightly antagonistic), there is a convergent stable singular strategy whose basin of attraction is almost the entire strategy space (0,1). This singular strategy is evolutionarily unstable and serves as an evolutionary branching point. Following evolutionary branching, our analysis and numerical simulations suggest that evolutionary dynamics are driven toward an end state consisting of two populations specializing on different resources. Fifth, when alpha>>1, there is only one singular strategy and it is convergent unstable and evolutionarily unstable. Hence, if resources are overly antagonistic, evolutionary branching does not occur and ultimately only one resource is exploited. !!},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have shown contrasting effects of temporal correlation of environmental fluctuations (red noise) on the risk of population extinction. It is still debated whether and under which conditions red noise increases or decreases extinction risk compared with uncorrelated (white) noise. Here, we explain the opposing effects by introducing two features of red noise time series. On the one hand, positive autocorrelation increases the probability of series of poor environmental conditions, implying increasing extinction risk. On the other hand, for a given time period, the probability of at least one extremely bad year (``catastrophe'') is reduced compared with white noise, implying decreasing extinction risk. Which of these two features determines extinction risk depends on the strength of environmental fluctuations and the sensitivity of population dynamics to these fluctuations. If extreme (catastrophic) events can occur (strong noise) or sensitivity is high (overcompensatory density dependence), then temporal correlation decreases extinction risk; otherwise, it increases it. Thus, our results provide a simple explanation for the contrasting previous findings and are a crucial step toward a general understanding of the effect of noise color on extinction risk. },

  Abstract                 = {1. We investigate the potential effects of parasitoid egg limitation on host-parasitoid population dynamics. We define a parasitoid as egg-limited if a shortage of eggs means that at some time she cannot utilize an opportunity to oviposit. 2. We develop models which consider the differing physiologies of pro-ovigenic and synovigenic parasitoids to investigate the potential consequences of egg limitation. Pro-ovigenic parasitoids emerge with their full complement of mature eggs. Synovigenic parasitoids also emerge with some eggs, but can mature more later in life. 3. The models indicate that egg limitation in pro-ovigenic parasitoids has no effect on stability. This result is independent of the egg load distribution in newly emerged parasitoids, and of the maximum number of eggs with which a female emerges. In synovigenic models, however, egg limitation is found to be destabilizing, though the reduction in stability is decreased by (i) an increase in egg load at emergence, and (ii) a decrease in the `latent' time required for egg maturation and gut emptying following a host meal. The latent period, during which time the full gut precludes feeding on hosts, differs from a conventional handling time in that host attacks (via oviposition) are still possible if the female has mature eggs. The maximum ovary storage capacity of females in a synovigenic parasitoid population has no effect on stability.},

  Abstract                 = {An existing model that examines the effects of habitat destruction in forest ecosystems is analysed in detail and modified for application to coral reefs. This allows a comparison of the relative rates of species extinctions, as habitat fragmentation increases, for the two different ecosystems. Field data from the reefs in Eilat, Israel, suggests that a large class of corals have both poor recruitment abilities and low abundances; characteristics that make these corals highly sensitive to disturbance. In such a scenario, the model finds coral reefs to be extremely fragile, and predicts a relatively large number of species extinctions with only mild habitat destruction. The unusual effects of species indirect interactions are also analysed, and the equilibrium distributions of species abundances are determined analytically for a wide range of parameter regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the growth of multitype branching processes in a random environment (MBPRE). It is shown that, under suitable regularity conditions, the process either explodes of becomes extinct. A classification theorem is given delineating the cases of explosion or extinction. Furthermore, it is shown that the process grows at an exponential rate on its set of non-extinction provided the process is stable. Criteria is given for non-certain extinction of the MBPRE to occur, and an example shows that the stability condition cannot be removed. The method of proof used, in general, is direct probabilistic computation rather than the classical functional iteration techniques. Growth theorems are first proved for increasing MBPRE and subsequently transferred to general MBPRE using the associated MBPRE and the reduced MBPRE.},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic theory of limiting similarity is presented that attempts to quantify the relationship between tolerable niche overlap among competing species and the degree of environmental fluctuation. The theory is based on a heuristic analytical approximation that provides conditions under which a rare invading species can increase in the presence of a community of established competitors. The major qualitative conclusion, derived from investigating two symmetric, discrete-time, stochastic analogs of the Lotka-Volterra competition equations, is that weak to moderate stochastic variation does not appear to limit significantly the similarity of competing species. This result is in sharp contrast to the conclusions of May and MacArthur's pioneering study of stochastic limiting similarity. A possible reason for this discrepancy is explored.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical analysis of natural selection is presented in which fitnesses depend on population density and randomly varying environmental processes. The theory is based on a general, heuristic analysis of a pair of coupled, nonlinear, stochastic difference equations that describe the joint dynamics of allele frequencies and population size. Four main conclusions emerge from the investigation of a particular class of models: (i) growth rates at low population densities tend to increase; (ii) individual selection, given sufficient genetic flexibility, will mold growth rates at higher densities so that in spite of i, stable deterministic population dynamics are maintained; (iii) ``more fit'' genotypes cannot be simply characterized--in particular, the mean population size need not be increased; and (iv) genetic polymorphisms can be maintained in both haploid and diploid organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies suggest that selection can allow coexistence in situations where ecological dynamics lead to competitive exclusion, provided that there is a trade-off between traits optimal for interacting with conspecifics and traits optimal for interacting with heterospecifics. Despite compelling empirical evidence, there is no general framework for elucidating how and when selection will allow coexistence in natural communities. Here we develop such a framework for a mechanism that we term "neighbor-dependent selection." We show that this mechanism can both augment coexistence when ecological conditions allow for niche partitioning and enable coexistence when ecological conditions lead to competitive exclusion. The novel insight is that when ecological conditions lead to exclusion, neighbor-dependent selection can allow coexistence via cycles driven by an intransitive loop; selection causes one species to be a superior interspecific competitor when it is rare and an inferior interspecific competitor when it is abundant. Our framework predicts the conditions under which selection can enable coexistence, as opposed to merely augmenting it, and elucidates the effects of heritability on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that drive coexistence. Given increasing evidence that evolution operates on ecological timescales, our approach provides one means for evaluating the role of selection and trait evolution in species coexistence.},

  Abstract                 = {Whether or not a bird species will establish a new population after invasion of uncolonized habitat depends, from theory, on its life-history attributes and initial population size. Data about initial population sizes are often unobtainable for natural and deliberate avian invasions. In New Zealand, however, contemporary documentation of introduction efforts allowed us to systematically compare unsuccessful and successful invaders without bias. We obtained data for 79 species involved in 496 introduction events and used the present-day status of each species as the dependent variable in fitting multiple logistic regression models. We found that introduction efforts for species that migrated within their endemic ranges were significantly less likely to be successful than those for nonmigratory species with similar introduction efforts. Initial population size, measured as number of releases and as the minimum number of propagules liberated in New Zealand, significantly increased the probability of translocation success. A null model showed that species released more times had a higher probability per release of successful establishment. Among 36 species for which data were available, successful invaders had significantly higher natality/mortality ratios. Successful invaders were also liberated at significantly more sites. Invasion of New Zealand by exotic birds was therefore primarily related to management, an outcome that has implications for conservation biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The objectives of this study were to distinguish demographic source and sink habitats of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and to determine the factors influencing source-sink status prior to fledging. In Boulder County, Colorado, I monitored 591 nests between 1995 and 1997 in breeding habitats that were either natural (wetlands, tallgrass prairie) or anthropogenic (hayfields, roadside ditches). To determine source-sink status, I calculated the productivity necessary to offset mortality. Predation was the main determinant of source-sink status, while brood parasitism had virtually no impact on this population. Anthropogenic habitats consistently functioned as sinks throughout the three-year study. Sources occurred only in natural habitats, and source sites had fewer buildings nearby than did sinks. In addition, climate variability may have influenced reproduction by influencing egg-laying dates. In 1995, possible source habitats included tallgrass prairie and wetlands. In 1996, tallgrass prairie functioned as a strong source, but in 1997 none of the natural habitats functioned as sources. The Boulder suburban area appeared to function as a regional sink during this study, possibly because human activity attracts high densities of human-commensal predators such as raccoons and corvids that depredate Red-winged Blackbird nests.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar timescales. However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological dynamics are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions. Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator density affects predator-prey (rotifer-algal) cycles in laboratory microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our system that allows prey evolution. We verified the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population oscillations in nature cannot neglect potential effects from ongoing rapid evolution.},
