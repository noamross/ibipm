	Abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous `superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency. !!},

@article{amnat-09b,
	Abstract = {Biological invasions, including infectious disease
		  outbreaks and biocontrol introductions, often involve small
		  numbers of individuals arriving in spatially heterogeneous
		  environments. Small numbers lead to demographic
		  stochasticity, and spatial heterogeneity means that
		  establishment success depends critically on the
		  introduction sites and movement patterns of invaders. We
		  present a general stochastic modeling framework to address
		  how spatial heterogeneity and movement patterns determine
		  establishment success, population growth, and rates of
		  spatial spread. For dispersal-limited populations, our
		  analysis reveals that spatial heterogeneity increases the
		  expected population growth rate and that local reproductive
		  numbers determine establishment success. Higher dispersal
		  rates decrease the expected population growth rate, but can
		  enhance establishment success, particularly when movement
		  patterns are positively correlated with local reproductive
		  numbers. We also find that several small, randomly
		  distributed propagules of invaders are more likely to
		  succeed than a single large propagule. Even if invasions
		  are ultimately successful, there may be substantial time
		  lags before an invader reaches observable densities. These
		  time lags are longer for invasions into patches where
		  extinction risk is high and in landscapes where
		  metapopulation-scale population growth rate is low, while
		  the opposite holds true for rates of spatial spread.
		  Sensitivity analysis of our models provides guidance for
		  control efforts.!!},

@article{tanny-81,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the growth of multitype
		  branching processes in a random environment (MBPRE). It is
		  shown that, under suitable regularity conditions, the
		  process either explodes of becomes extinct. A
		  classification theorem is given delineating the cases of
		  explosion or extinction. Furthermore, it is shown that the
		  process grows at an exponential rate on its set of
		  non-extinction provided the process is stable. Criteria is
		  given for non-certain extinction of the MBPRE to occur, and
		  an example shows that the stability condition cannot be
		  removed. The method of proof used, in general, is direct
		  probabilistic computation rather than the classical
		  functional iteration techniques. Growth theorems are first
		  proved for increasing MBPRE and subsequently transferred to
		  general MBPRE using the associated MBPRE and the reduced
		  MBPRE.},
